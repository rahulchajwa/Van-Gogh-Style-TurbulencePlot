The codes given herewith plots the results of 'active_in_turbulence' repository based on the manuscript: Active Caustics https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01829 by R. Chajwa et al.

The compilation of the simulation given in active_in_turbulence yields the fluid variable in the 512x512 grids in a 2 $` pi `$ periodic domain stored in %.dat file with the number denoting time-stamp
the trajectories of the particles are stored in 'trajectories%.dat' file with the corresponding time-stamp. 

We use the matlab repository https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/fileexchange/v1?id=69470 to define our custom colormap in vgmovie.m. For completeness we include the function customcolormap.m

The result of our simulation looks as follows:
